# Ludum Dare 38

[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) is a Game Jam which occurs every 4 months, where creators are challenged to make a game from scratch in a single weekend.
Creators may enter either the 48 hour "Competition", or the 72 hour "Jam".  Those entering the Competition must work alone and create all
of their code, models, textures, sound, music, etc. themselves.  Using an existing Game Engine is permitted, however.

The theme for this event, which was my also my first ever entry into Ludum Dare, was <b>"A Small World"</b>.

My main goal for this event was to create something in 3d, potentially with a rigged model and some simple animations.
I also wanted to incorporate an idea of "possessing" various inanimate objects in order to solve a puzzle.

To fit this into the "Small World" theme, I went with the idea of playing as a child's soul trapped in its (former) bedroom,  
and possessing various toys in order to escape.

Tools Used:
* Unity 5.5
* Blender
* GIMP
